Program Deliverable Checklist

Does the program compile without errors?
Yes.

Does the program compile without warnings?
Yes.

Does the program run without crashing?
Yes.

Describe how you tested the program.
By creating a test program that utilized the catch framework using the methods found in the Complex class, and with manual computation of complex numbers to compare results with. Test.cpp tests each of the methods found in the class.

Describe the ways in which the program does not meet assignment's specifications.
The Test.cpp was not as thorough as I would have liked, and I was not able to find a way to test the input/output streams automatically. Additionally, the implementation for dividing complex numbers is not completely correct, as it does not only use simple formulaic computation to figure out.

Describe all known and suspected bugs.
I suspect some of the functions have unnecessary consts, or it's missing them. Also, returning complex numbers worked in testing, but might need further refinement. 

Does the program run correctly?
Yes.
